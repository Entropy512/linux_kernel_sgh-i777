Description:
		If CMA has been built with SysFS support,
		/sys/kernel/mm/contiguous/ contains a file called
		"map", a file called "allocators" and a directory
		called "regions".

		The "map" file lets one change the CMA's map attribute
		at run-time.

		The "allocators" file list all registered allocators.
		Allocators with no name are listed as a single minus
		sign.

		The "regions" directory list all reserved regions.

		For more details see
		Documentation/contiguous-memory.txt.

What:		/sys/kernel/mm/contiguous/regions/
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Michal Nazarewicz <m.nazarewicz@samsung.com>
Description:
		The /sys/kernel/mm/contiguous/regions/ directory
		contain directories for each registered CMA region.
		The name of the directory is the same as the start
		address of the region.

		If region is named there is also a symbolic link named
		like the region pointing to the region's directory.

		Such directory contains the following files:

		* "name"  -- the name of the region or an empty file
		* "start" -- starting address of the region (formatted
		            with %p, ie. hex).
		* "size"  -- size of the region (in bytes).
		* "free"  -- free space in the region (in bytes).
		* "users" -- number of chunks allocated in the region.
		* "alloc" -- name of the allocator.

		If allocator is not attached to the region, "alloc" is
		either the name of desired allocator in square
		brackets (ie. "[foo]") or an empty file if region is
		to be attached to default allocator.  If an allocator
		is attached to the region. "alloc" is either its name
		or "-" if attached allocator has no name.

		If there are no chunks allocated in given region
		("users" is "0") then a name of desired allocator can
		be written to "alloc".
